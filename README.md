## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kaung, I am  a recent Physics MSci graduate from the University of Nottingham. 
I have some personal and course related projects which will be uploaded to showcase my experiences! 

My 4th Year Master's project was a group project where we collaborated to "Simulate the Universe using Diffusion Models".
My 3rd Year project involved collaborating with a partner to find regions of brain activation for stimulus response.
